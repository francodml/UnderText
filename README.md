# UnderText for your Garry's Mod
## A simple textbox that renders text character by character while making a sound and showing a picture.

Initially intended to be part of a full Undertale engine "clone" (think Unitale) for Gmod, UnderText takes your text and renders it fancily on a text box like Undertale does. 

It supports character portraits, sounds, and has a queue system, so you could input an entire table of dialog and have the engine automatically handle it in sequence for you. Special characters (commas, periods, question and exclamation marks, colons and semicolons) automatically delay the text for you.
